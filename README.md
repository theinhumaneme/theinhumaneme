# Kalyan Mudumby

MSCS @ Northeastern University (Boston) • I build AI-powered apps **and** the platforms that keep them fast and reliable.

- Built a production **RAG** system (LangChain) for a government client
- Shipped performance wins across **40+ apps** (100× faster cache loads, 5× faster page loads)
- Rust-first tooling for deployment automation and developer workflows

**Looking for:** 2026 internship / co-op roles in **AI/ML** or **platform engineering**.

## Featured projects

- **[Hikari](https://github.com/theinhumaneme/hikari)** — lightweight deployment manager for small VM fleets  
  Rust + Docker + WebSockets • config watcher → deploy/update/cleanup  
  Notes: AES-256 config encryption, daemon mode, and an agent/server design (axum + tokio + Postgres).  
  Write-ups: [Daemon mode](https://kalyanmudumby.com/post/rule-vms-with-hikari/) • [Realtime scaling](https://kalyanmudumby.com/post/going-realtime-with-hikari/)

- **[Autodeploy](https://github.com/theinhumaneme/autodeploy)** — single Rust binary that turns a TOML config into a working local deployment  
  Generates Docker Compose on the fly + interactive TUI (git2, inquire).  
  Write-up: [Hassle-free deployments](https://kalyanmudumby.com/post/hasslefree-deployments-with-autodeploy/)

- **[Fetal Health Classification](https://github.com/theinhumaneme/major)** — ML pipeline for CTG-based risk classification  
  Python (scikit-learn/SciPy) + Flask backend + Angular UI • Dockerized end-to-end  
  Reported accuracy: 97.8%

- **[Documan (Java rewrite)](https://github.com/theinhumaneme/documan-java21)** — digital library backend rewrite + infra experiments  
  (Original platform: 4,000+ students / 200k+ file deliveries — details in resume)
